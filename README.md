# PowerCalc

## About
This web app is designed to simulate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand at a parking facility, designed for shop owners who want to plan EV charging stations without overburdening their power infrastructure. The dashboard allows users to adjust key parameters and view projections of energy consumption, peak power demand, and charging patterns.
